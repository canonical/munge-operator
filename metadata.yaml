summary: An authentication service built for HPC clusters.
description: |
  MUNGE (MUNGE Uid 'N' Gid Emporium) is an authentication service for creating
  and validating credentials. It is designed to be highly scalable for use in
  an HPC cluster environment. It allows a process to authenticate the UID and
  GID of another local or remote process within a group of hosts having common
  users and groups. These hosts form a security realm that is defined by a
  shared cryptographic key. Clients within this security realm can create and
  validate credentials without the use of root privileges, reserved ports, or
  platform-specific methods.
